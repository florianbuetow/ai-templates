# Delegating Work to Sub-Agents via tmux

> The #1 mistake agents make: **pasting a prompt into tmux and forgetting to send Enter**.
> If you don't send Enter, **nothing happens**. The prompt sits there forever. Codex never sees it.

> **Every single prompt you send must end with a SEPARATE `tmux send-keys -t '$SESSION:0.0' Enter` call.**
> (where `$SESSION` is the unique tmux session name you created — see Session Setup below)
>
> This is not optional. This is not implicit. You must explicitly send Enter as its own Bash tool call.
> If you skip this step, you will waste the entire session waiting for a response that will never come.

## Session Setup

Every delegation starts by creating a **new tmux session** with a unique name. Never reuse an existing session.

### 1. Generate a Unique Session Name
Pick a name that does not collide with any existing tmux session. Use a timestamp or random suffix:
```bash
SESSION="codex-$(date +%s)"
# Verify it doesn't already exist
tmux has-session -t "$SESSION" 2>/dev/null && echo "COLLISION — pick another name" || echo "OK: $SESSION"
```
Save the value of `$SESSION` — you will use it in **every** tmux command for the rest of this delegation.

### 2. Create the Session, CD into the Working Directory, and Launch Codex
```bash
# Create a detached tmux session and cd into the project root
tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -c "$(pwd)"
# Launch Codex inside the session
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" 'codex' Enter
```

### 3. Verify Codex Started with the Correct Model
Wait a few seconds, then confirm Codex is running and shows **model 5.3 high** (the default):
```bash
sleep 5 && tmux capture-pane -t "$SESSION:0.0" -p | tail -15
```
You should see the Codex UI with `5.3 high` displayed as the active model. If not, investigate before proceeding.

### Key Rules
- Do NOT launch Claude Code (`claude`) in the session — always use the `codex` CLI
- Do NOT reuse or attach to an existing tmux session — always create a fresh one
- The agent is highly capable and can handle complex, long-running tasks given precise instructions
- Do NOT underestimate it — delegate aggressively, not conservatively

## Understanding the Agent's Behavior
- Treat the agent like it is extremely literal-minded: it follows instructions with exact precision, no more, no less
- It will work tirelessly for hours on a task without complaint — give it the full scope, not just a small piece
- It only stops when your instructions are ambiguous or insufficient for it to continue
- If it stops or asks a question, that means YOUR instructions were unclear — fix the instructions, not the agent
- Ambiguity is the enemy: every detail you leave unspecified is a potential point where the agent will halt or guess wrong
- Give it zero-ambiguity instructions with complete context and it will deliver
- The agent excels at execution — writing code, running tests, committing — but not at planning or design decisions
- YOU are the planner and architect; the agent is the executor. Plan thoroughly, then delegate the full implementation

## Sending Messages

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Every Prompt Requires a Separate Enter ⚠️

Codex does NOT auto-submit. After you type or paste a prompt, **nothing happens until you press Enter**. If you forget Enter, the prompt sits there forever and you will wait indefinitely for a response that never comes.

**For short prompts (single Bash call):**
```bash
# The trailing Enter submits the prompt
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" 'Your message here' Enter
```

**For multi-line prompts (load-buffer + paste-buffer):**
```bash
# Bash call 1: Load multi-line prompt into buffer
cat << 'EOF' | tmux load-buffer -
Your multi-line prompt here
EOF
# Bash call 1 (continued): Paste it into the codex pane
tmux paste-buffer -t "$SESSION:0.0"
```
```bash
# Bash call 2 — THIS IS THE STEP YOU WILL FORGET — DO NOT SKIP IT:
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" Enter
```

**Rules:**
- **NEVER** chain Enter with `&&` in the same command — it gets lost
- **ALWAYS** send Enter as a **separate Bash tool call** after pasting
- **ALWAYS** verify the prompt was submitted: `sleep 5 && tmux capture-pane -t "$SESSION:0.0" -p | tail -10`
- If the captured output still shows your prompt text sitting in the input area, **you forgot Enter**

### Checklist — After Every Prompt Submission

Before moving on, confirm ALL of these:
1. ✅ Did I send the prompt text? (`send-keys` or `paste-buffer`)
2. ✅ Did I send Enter as a **separate** Bash call? (`tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" Enter`)
3. ✅ Did I verify submission? (`sleep 5 && tmux capture-pane -t "$SESSION:0.0" -p | tail -10`)

### Exact Session Targeting
`-t codex` does **prefix matching** and will hit other sessions like `codex-e2e`. Always use the exact pane address with your unique `$SESSION` name to avoid ambiguity:
```bash
# WRONG — matches any session starting with "codex"
tmux send-keys -t codex "..."

# CORRECT — targets exactly your session, window 0, pane 0
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" "..."
```
Use `$SESSION:0.0` everywhere: `send-keys`, `capture-pane`, etc.

### Cancelling a Prompt First
When the agent is waiting at a Yes/No prompt:
```bash
# Call 1: Cancel the prompt
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" Escape
# Call 2: Wait for it to process (separate Bash call)
sleep 2
# Call 3: Send your new message
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" "Your correction here"
# Call 4: Submit it
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" Enter
```

### Reading Agent Output
```bash
# See current screen
tmux capture-pane -t "$SESSION:0.0" -p | tail -50

# Don't sleep+check in one command if user might interrupt
# Instead, check immediately or use short sleeps
```

## Priming the Agent

### After /clear or Starting a New Task
When starting fresh (after `/clear` or a new session), the agent has no project context. Always prime it:
1. Tell it to read `AGENTS.md` first — this contains project conventions, architecture, testing rules
2. List the specific files relevant to the task it should read
3. Tell it to use `uv run` for all Python execution — never raw `python` or `pip install`
4. Tell it not to modify existing test files in `tests/`
5. Only THEN give the task instructions

### Example Priming Message
```
Read these files FIRST before doing anything:
1. AGENTS.md — project conventions, architecture, testing rules
2. docs/service-implementation-guide.md — how to implement a service from scaffolding
3. docs/specifications/<service>-specs.md — the API specification for the service
4. <file> — <why it's relevant>

After reading all files, implement the following fix/feature.
<detailed instructions>

Use `uv run` for all Python execution — never use raw python, python3, or pip install.
Do NOT modify any existing test files in tests/.
```

## Giving Instructions

### Be Explicit and Comprehensive
The agent works best with:
- Exact file paths to read first
- Exact commands to run for verification
- Clear sequence of tasks
- What NOT to do (e.g., "Do not use pip install, use uv sync")
- Enforce TDD: "Write tests first, verify they fail, then implement"
- Tell it existing tests are acceptance tests that must not be modified
- Tell it to add new test files instead of modifying existing ones

### First Message Template
```
Read <spec-file> FIRST before doing anything. It is your single source of truth.
Follow it to the letter. Do not improvise. Do not deviate.
Execute Phase 1 through Phase N in order.
After EACH phase, run: just test (from the service directory)
After ALL phases, run: just ci (from the service directory)
Commit after each phase as specified.
Use `uv run` for all Python execution — never use raw python or pip install.
Do NOT modify existing test files in tests/ — add new test files instead.
If you cannot run a command due to sandbox restrictions, tell me and I will run it for you.
Important files to read: (1) ... (2) ... (3) ...
START NOW by reading the spec file.
```

### Correcting the Agent Mid-Task
- Cancel current prompt with Escape first
- Be direct: "STOP. Do X instead of Y."
- Tell it what went wrong and what to do differently

## Monitoring the Agent

### Automatic Periodic Checks — MANDATORY
After sending instructions to the agent, you MUST automatically check on it periodically. Never ask the user to check — do it yourself.

**Polling pattern — use sleep to enforce wait:**
```bash
sleep 30 && tmux capture-pane -t "$SESSION:0.0" -p | tail -40
```

The `sleep` in the same command prevents rapid-fire polling. Adjust the sleep duration:
- **First check after sending instructions:** `sleep 15 && ...`
- **Agent is working normally:** `sleep 30 && ...`
- **Agent is in a long-running task (npm install, CI):** `sleep 60 && ...`

**NEVER** call `tmux capture-pane` without a preceding `sleep` in the same command. This is the only way to enforce discipline.

**What to look for on each check:**
- Is it waiting at a Yes/No permission prompt? → Answer it immediately
- Is it stuck or asking a question? → Provide the answer or clarify instructions
- Is it actively working (spinner, "Working")? → Leave it alone, check again later
- Has it finished? → Review the output and proceed

## Agent Limitations

### What It Cannot Do
- Run tmux-based TUI tests (sandbox restriction on tmux)
- Access authenticated services
- Run Docker commands (may be restricted)

### What I Must Handle
- All ticket operations (create, close, sync)
- Running integration tests that require services to be running
- Final CI validation (`just ci-quiet` from root) — ALWAYS run this, never skip

### When It Gets Stuck
- Permission errors on files → tell it to create new files instead of modifying
- Sandbox restrictions → offer to run commands for it and report results
- Missing tools → tell it to skip and you'll handle it

## Session Teardown

When the agent has finished ALL work and you have reviewed the results, you MUST cleanly shut down the session:

### 1. Exit Codex
```bash
# Send /exit to quit the Codex CLI
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" '/exit' Enter
```

### 2. Wait for Codex to Exit, Then Terminate the tmux Session
```bash
# Wait for Codex to shut down
sleep 3
# Type exit to close the shell and terminate the tmux session
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" 'exit' Enter
```

### 3. Verify the Session is Gone
```bash
tmux has-session -t "$SESSION" 2>/dev/null && echo "ERROR: session still alive" || echo "OK: session terminated"
```

**NEVER** leave tmux sessions running after work is complete. Every delegation that creates a session must also destroy it.

---

## Review Protocol

### ALWAYS Validate with CI
After the agent finishes ALL work, ALWAYS run from the service directory:
```bash
just ci-quiet
```
This is the definitive validation. Do NOT rely on `just test` alone — it misses:
- Format checks (ruff format)
- Lint checks (ruff check)
- Type checking (mypy, pyright)
- Security scanning (bandit)
- Spell checking (codespell)
- Custom rules (semgrep)

If `just ci-quiet` fails, investigate the failure. Common causes:
- Import ordering or formatting issues
- Type annotation missing or incorrect
- New dependencies not added to pyproject.toml
- Spelling errors in docstrings or variable names

### After Each Phase
- Check git log to verify commits
- Read the code it produced
- Run `just ci-quiet` (not just `just test`)
- Only close tickets after CI passes

### Quality Checks
- Does the code match the spec?
- Architecture rules respected? (no forbidden imports, business logic in services/ not routers/)
- Does `just ci-quiet` pass? (the ONLY check that matters)
- No default parameter values in configurable settings?
- Config loaded from config.yaml, not hardcoded?
- Pydantic models use `ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`?

## Anti-Patterns (Mistakes to Avoid)

1. **Being too conservative** — The agent can handle complex work. Delegate the full feature, not just the foundation.
2. **Guessing test outcomes** — Never claim a test will pass or fail without running it. Run `just ci-quiet` to verify.
3. **Forgetting Enter** — The #1 failure mode. After `paste-buffer`, you MUST send `tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:0.0" Enter` as a separate Bash call. Without it, the prompt sits in the input area forever and Codex never processes it. If you are waiting more than 30 seconds and Codex hasn't started working, **you forgot Enter**.
4. **Not enforcing TDD** — Explicitly tell the agent to write tests first, verify they fail, then implement.
5. **Not telling it about existing test files** — Tell it existing tests are acceptance tests that must not be modified.
6. **Running `just test` instead of `just ci-quiet`** — `just test` only covers pytest. `just ci-quiet` is the full CI pipeline including format, lint, type checks, security, and tests. Always use `just ci-quiet` for final validation.
7. **Not priming with AGENTS.md** — The agent needs project context. Always make it read AGENTS.md first.
8. **Letting it use pip install** — All Python execution must go through `uv run`. All dependency management through `uv sync`.
9. **Not tearing down the tmux session** — Every delegation must end by exiting Codex (`/exit`) and terminating the tmux session (`exit`). Leaked sessions waste resources and cause name collisions.
