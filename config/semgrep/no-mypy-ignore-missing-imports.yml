    message: |
      Ignoring missing imports is not allowed in mypy configuration.
      Do NOT add or keep: 'ignore_missing_imports = true' in [[tool.mypy.overrides]].
      Install proper type stubs instead (types-*, stub packages, or py.typed markers).
      If a library truly has no type information available, the proper solution is to:
      1. Check if type stubs exist: `pip search types-<library>` or check typeshed
      2. Install the stub package: add it to pyproject.toml dependencies
      3. If no stubs exist, create a minimal stub file in your project
      4. Consider contributing type stubs to typeshed or the upstream project
      Silently ignoring missing imports defeats the purpose of static type checking.
