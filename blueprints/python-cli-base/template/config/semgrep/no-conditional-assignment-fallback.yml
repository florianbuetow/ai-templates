      Conditional assignment of fallback value hides missing data.
      Use explicit validation and raise an error when the value is expected but missing.

      IMPORTANT: This pattern is a code quality violation because it makes debugging more difficult
      by hiding the root cause of missing data. When a required value is missing, the code must fail
      immediately and explicitly at the point where the problem is detected.

      Example violations:
        # WRONG - assigns "Unknown" fallback
        var = source.get("key")
        if var is None:
            var = "Unknown"

        # CORRECT - raise error for missing required value
        var = source.get("key")
        if var is None:
            raise ValueError("Required field 'key' is missing")

      Use explicit validation and raise an error when the value is unexpected.
